# just-killing-monsters
A home game project aimed to train my programmer skills.
I tried to make the code clean and readable, although the game itself is not supposed to be super entertaining :D

For now it's basically a console application with some GUI, but i am working on some simple graphics for the game too.

I also added some makeshift documentation(outdated now). Go to documentation/html/index.html

Executables are on my Google Drive: https://goo.gl/eB3bQJ in c++ folder.

This project uses GPL open source license distribution of Qt.
