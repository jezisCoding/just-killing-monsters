# just-killing-monsters
A home game project aimed to train and display my developer skills.

For now it's only a console application, but i am currently working on some simple graphics for the game too(apart from other features).

Executables are on my Google Drive: https://goo.gl/eB3bQJ in c++ folder
I also added some makeshift documentation. Go to documentation/html/index.html

This project uses GPL open source license distribution of Qt.
