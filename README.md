# just-killing-monsters
A home game project aimed to train and display my programmer skills.

For now it's basically a console application with GUI, but i am working on some simple graphics for the game too(apart from other features).

Executables are on my Google Drive: https://goo.gl/eB3bQJ in c++ folder,
there are 2 console versions and 1 GUI version. They should all be executable on all desktop platforms(only tested on Windows 10 though).
I also added some makeshift documentation. Go to documentation/html/index.html

This project uses GPL open source license distribution of Qt.
