# just-killing-monsters
A home game project to train my programming skills.
For now it's only a console application, but i am currently working on some simple graphics for the game too(apart from other features).

I tried to make the code clean and readable, although i don't have documentation for it yet.

This project uses GPL open source license distribution of Qt.
